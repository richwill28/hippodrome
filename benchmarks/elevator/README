This is the elevator benchmark used in ORD, Velodrome etc. The current version
checked in should support both Jikes/Octet and other tools such as RR/Atomizer. 
However, we will need to use different .class files, since the Jikes version
is slightly modified to include harness and MMTk. 


The folder structure is as follows:

  src - contains files modified (only Elevator.java) to support harness and MMTk

  original - contains the original .class files as distributed. Use these .class
  files for execution with tools such as RR/Atomizer 


To execute with Jikes/Octet:

  EXP uses elevator.jar as the input. 

For other tools:


To compile for other tools: 

  ant (see build.xml) 

  or, 

  javac -cp $HOME/benchmarks/elevator/src/ Elevator.java


Elevator usage is:

  java elevator.Elevator <input>

  The data files can be used as sample input files.


To get the modified (Jikes/Octet) .class files, either compile the source, 
or unjar the .jar file. 


Execute RR/Atomizer:
  rrrun -tool=A elevator.Elevator <data_file>
  rrrun -tool=A elevator.Elevator data -xml
